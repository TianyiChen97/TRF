# Examples

Here our group has provided example of our 4 different models using the [sample.csv](sample.csv). Because our data cannot be published publicly, we have created sample.csv to illustrate our examples. The way how we generated sample.csv can be found at [Generate Synthetic Data folder](Generate_Synthetic_Data).
